# Webpack Stylus Pug Starter
Sometimes I just need a setup to develop web-design ideas very quickly. This setup gives me the same developing experience as platforms like Codepen or jsfiddle, but is faster and enables me to use my favourite Text Editor.

Through webpack's hot module replacement CSS will be updated live, while the browser does not make a reload (if the HTML was not changed).

## Getting Started
First `npm i` to install dependencies.

Then just `npm run dev` and edit the files located in `src`.

If you want to have the webpage in a single html-file, use `npm build`.

## Disclaimer
This setup is minimal and it might not suffice your requirements - feel free to extend it!
