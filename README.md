# Stylus-Pug-Starter
Simple Stylus Pug Webdesign Starter Pack. Driven by Webpack allowing Dev-Server with HMR.

Sometimes I just need a setup to develop web-design ideas very quickly. This setup gives me the same developing experience as platforms like Codepen, but enables me to use my favourite Text Editor.

Just run `npm run dev` and you're ready to go!

TODO: Add `npm build` implementation in config to build clean html/css which would be deployable on static hosters like github pages
